#Section 1: Introduction, Question, Goals and Hypotheses (400 words)
##A)
Introduce relevant concepts: 
- State of salmon in BC
- Salmon diet
- Herring as a prey item for salmon
- Gape size theory
- Yearly availbaility of herring of different sizes
- Regional differences

How the dataset was collected:
- Salmon stomachs donated to Juanes lab by anglers
- Salmon stomach contents sorted and classfied based on digestion
- Otoliths collected and measured

 Background needed to understand the dataset:
- Otolith width as the best proxy for herring length

At least two scientiÔ¨Åc papers that are related to your topic:

##B)
Research question:
- What physiological, environmental and temporal factors determine the size of herring eaten by Chinook salmon in the Salish Sea

##C)
Goal of research: 
- Description, because we want to know what variables best explain the patterns in the size of herring eaten by Chinook salmon 

##D)
Hypothesis:
- Salmon Length: Positive non-linear relationship, logarithmic curve where asymptote is maximum herring size
- Collection day of year: Non-linear, positive quadratic function where vertex is midway through the year
- latitude: linear, positive relationship with increasing latitude
- longitude: non-linear, positive quadratic function where the vertex occurs at mid-channel points longitudinally through the Strait of Georgia Channel...
- salmon id: no relationship
-interactions: ? 


##E)
Model selection:
- We want to determine what factors explain patterns in the size of herring eaten by salmon 
- So we want to choose a model which best describes this pattern
- Our possible models are not nested, we aren't testing a null model
- We have a fairly small sample size
- Use the AICc

#Section 2: The Response Variable (150 words)
##A)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Add column for number of rows
n <- nrow(herring_data)
herring_data$row <- 1:n

#Dotchart of otolith width (response variable)
with(herring_data, plot(oto.width, row, las = 1, type = "n", xlab = "Otolith width [mm]", ylab = "Row Number"))
abline (h = seq(1, n, by = 5), col = "lightgrey")
with(herring_data, points(oto.width, row, las = 1, type = "p", pch = 19, cex = 0.5))

#Histogram of response variable with rugmarks
hist(herring_data$oto.width, xlim = c(0.3, 2.8), breaks = seq(0.2, 2.8, by = 0.05), col = grey(0.9), main = "Histogram of herring otolith width", xlab = "Herring otolith width")
rug(herring_data$oto.width)

#Checking for zeroes and NAs in otilith width
table(herring_data$oto.width > 0, useNA = "always")

#exclude rows with NAs for continuous variables
herring_data <- herring_data %>% na.omit()

```

##B) 
Qualitative description of response variable:
- Continuous 
- Bounded by 0, can't take negative values

##C)
Potential issues with response variable
- Intially no zeroes and one missing value
- We removed the single NA value for all subsequent analyses - this was a vial with a missing/lost otolith pair - expect no difficulties omitting this NA value (say something about salmon length?)
- Outliers at > 2.2 mm and < 0.6 mm, but they're biologically reasonable and could represent a few individuals at extreme age classes
- Non-independence is expected from repeated measurements of multiple herring that occurred within the same salmon stomach/experimental unit. It is likely that similar sized herring will occur in the same school targeted by a salmon.

- We expect non-idependence of herring size both from temporal and spatial autocorrelation. Sources of temporal autocorrelation could be that herring consumed by salmon at the same time of year have similar growth trajectories. Sources of spatial autocorrelation of herring size may include the fact that herring in a similar area have similar feeding resources and grow rates in addition to smaller fish that occur closer to subtidal habitats compared to larger fish that occur in deeper, pelagic habitats which may contribute to spatial autocorrelation.

##D)
Candidate distributions for variable
- We are most likely to use the normal distribution. While the distribution is bound by 0 we have continuous data values (non-integer) and it is mostly symmetrical around the mean.

##B)
- Outliers - For the continuous explanatory variable salmon length, there is one outlier at 45cm and three outliers between 90-100cm; however, these are reasonable sizes for recreationally caught chinook salmon. While not considered outliers, there are few larger salmon that have large weights. 
- Transformations why or why not? We may want to transform weight and length as they appear slightly right-skewed. **note: we must decide this later.

#Balance of dataset (if appropriate)

```
Comment on balance - Referring to tables in section 3: we observe more salmon samples collected between March(3) to July(7) compared to other months and there are more females than males, although there is a high number of unsexed fish in this dataset. There is a higher number of herring categorized as digestion level 2, 3 and 4 compared to level 1. The difficulties we may encounter is to include sex if only 2/3 of the fish are sexed, therefore, it will be harder to evaluate whether sex is a useful predictor or not. The unbalanced nature of temporal sampling, it will be harder to evaluate the relationship during winter months. There isn't simultaneous unbalancing across multiple variables, we only see holes, so this is less likely to be confounding but rather limiting in making any generalized conclusions about how sex and the winter period relates to herring size consumed by salmon.

Comment on pairwise scatterplots - there is a strong positive relationship between Chinook length and weight (0.91) in addition to a strong positive relationship between collection day in 2018 and collection month in 2018. While there isn't an obvious linear relationship between salmon length and weigth vs collection day and collection month, there is evidence for a concave up relationship between collection day of year and collection day of month with length and weight, perhaps due to seasonality of salmon caught during the spring and summer months. There is a strong positive relationship between collection day and collection month which is expected since collection month is pooled data of collection day. There is a strong negative relationship between latitude and longitude (-0.83).

Comment on VIFs - The VIF values of salmon length (6.818335), weight (6.932405), latitude (3.954376) and longitude (3.823013) are greater than 3 and therefore strongly colinear.

Comment on potential difficulties from correlations and benefits - the difficulty will be including both length and weight, both latitude and longitute and both month and day of year in our statistical models. We would want to include either length or weight, either latitude or longitude and either month or day of year, so that they don't confound each other. Seasonality in salmon size (length and weigth) may confound the relationship between these two variables.
